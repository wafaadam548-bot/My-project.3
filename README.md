# WCI Questions  

## About the Project  
WCI is my school in Canada. I am new in this country, and I noticed that finding answers to questions on their main website is very difficult.  
So, I created this simple website to help new people and students who are searching for answers. If they donâ€™t find what they need, they can contact us, and we will respond quickly.  

## Features  
- Simple website  
- A lot of questions  
- Beautiful and attractive design  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS** (internal styling) for basic design  

## Author  
- **Wafa Adam**
